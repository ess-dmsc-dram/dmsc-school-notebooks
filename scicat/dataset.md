# Dataset

## What is a dataset?

In order to make sense of all the material in this section, we need to set the correct foundations and provide a clear definition of what is a __dataset__.
There are many definitions in the current literature, but all of them agree on the main concept which defines a dataset as a collection of related items.([1], [2], [3])

For our course and in the SciCat world, the definition that we follow is this:

### Dataset

A Dataset is a collection of multi-modal set of items which:
- shares a common source and/or were collected for a psecific purpose, 
- describes an individual or a series of events or experiment, 
- pertains to the same experimental data collection.  

A dataset might contain one or more files and must have a set of descriptors that, according to the current standards, are called metadata.
