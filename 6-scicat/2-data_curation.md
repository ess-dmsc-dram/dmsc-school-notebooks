# Data Curation

After reviewing the available literature on the topic (please see [1], [2], and [3] as sample), it has become evident to us that we should provide a clear definition of what data curation is in the context of science and, more specifically, in the context of our course and scientific community.  

Our definition of **data curation** is the following:

## Data Curation
> Data curation is the effort to organize multi-modal data (measurements and observations) collected during an experiment in an organized set, named dataset, with the purpose of making the data more logical, easy to find, understand and reproduce.

Data curation refers to the complete process of collecting the files with all the data measured during the experiment.
This includes the set of information that is available in lab notebooks or in the memory of scientists and all the actors involved in collecting, reducing, and analyzing such data.

In many cases, data curation is part of data management and has to follow the policies adopted under the data governance, or DMPs (data management plans).
In some cases, _data curation_ is used interchangeably with the term _data enrichment_, although that is not completely accurate.
In our vision, _data enrichment_ is the act of adding additional descriptors to a dataset as the data contained in the dataset is further explored and analyzed.
This definition makes it a step of what we see as data curation.
